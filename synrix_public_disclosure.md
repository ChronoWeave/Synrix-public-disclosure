# Synrix: A Temporal Knowledge Graph Operating System for Symbolic AI Self-Evolution on Edge Hardware

### Author: Ryan Frederick Daniel Barkley

## Abstract

Synrix is a self-evolving, temporal knowledge graph operating system (KG-OS) designed for edge-native deployment of symbolic and generative AI. Unlike curriculum-tuned domain specialists that rely on static multi-hop knowledge graphs (e.g., BDS models), Synrix introduces a fully temporal, agent-operable substrate that fuses knowledge representation, symbolic inference, memory orchestration, and edge-efficient runtime scheduling.

This system is purpose-built for continuous learning, agent autonomy, and consent-aware memory governance in constrained, real-world environments. It is capable of dynamic graph mutation, compression, and symbolic reflection without reliance on centralized training cycles or cloud-bound dependencies.

Synrix is platform-agnostic and designed to scale from edge inference to datacenter-level orchestration.

## Core Innovations

### 1. **ChronoNodes: Temporally Layered Knowledge Units**

- Nodes encode discrete events, facts, states, and agent memories as immutable, time-anchored knowledge atoms.
- Each ChronoNode is version-controlled, deduplicated, and tagged with temporal context, trust metadata, and consent lineage.
- Supports TTL (time-to-live), LRU (least-recently-used), and causal pruning strategies for local storage governance.

### 2. **Symbolic Embedding Graph (SEG): Tokenless Semantic Interface**

- Replaces conventional token-based input pipelines with symbolic concept graphs for interpretability and compression.
- Semantic units are linked directly to ChronoNodes and represent reversible mappings from structured domain knowledge.
- Enables direct manipulation, introspection, and reasoning over symbolic state.

### 3. **TimeFold: Semantic Compression Engine**

- Multi-layered compression engine using differential snapshotting, reversible symbol tables, and temporal folding.
- Optimized for deployment across constrained and high-performance environments alike — from edge devices to distributed compute clusters.
- Seamlessly integrates with SEG and ChronoNode architectures.

### 4. **Self-Evolving DAG Engine**

- Agents are expressed as DAGs over function-call sequences and state transitions.
- Evolution occurs via agent-internal proposals and scoring of alternate DAG branches.
- A reward loop evaluates agent branches against KG-derived utility functions and trust predicates.

### 5. **Consent-Aware Memory Governance**

- Each ChronoNode and symbolic state stores explicit consent metadata and access policy.
- Enables AI agents to self-regulate memory use and respect dynamic privacy boundaries at inference and storage levels.
- DAG evolution is rollback-capable, with persistent audit trails.

### 6. **Edge-Optimized Runtime (Jetson Orin Nano Class)**

- All components are deployable across heterogeneous compute environments, including low-power devices and high-throughput clusters, without requiring cloud dependency.
- Integrated TensorRT-LLM stack for quantized inference (e.g. DeepSeek-Coder 1.3B INT8).
- Multi-agent mesh can operate cooperatively across local knowledge graph partitions.
